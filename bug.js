This bug occurs when using the Expo `Constants.appOwnership` API to determine whether the app is running in development mode or production mode.  The API sometimes returns `null` even when the app is clearly running in one mode or the other. This is particularly problematic if your app's logic depends on this value to make critical decisions. For example, it may not properly fetch API keys or load specific features based on the environment.

```javascript
import Constants from 'expo-constants';

console.log(Constants.appOwnership);
// Expected output: 'expo' or 'user'
// Actual output: null
```
