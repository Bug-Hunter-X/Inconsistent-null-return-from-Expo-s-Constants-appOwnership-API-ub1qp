# Expo Constants.appOwnership API Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using the `Constants.appOwnership` API in Expo. The API occasionally returns `null` instead of the expected 'expo' or 'user', leading to unexpected behavior in the application.

## Bug Description
The `Constants.appOwnership` property is intended to indicate whether the app is running in a development environment ('expo') or in production ('user'). However, there are instances where it unexpectedly returns `null`, even when the app is clearly in one of these environments.

This makes it unreliable to base application logic or feature availability on this property alone.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the project using Expo Go or your preferred Expo development tools.
3. Observe the output of the `console.log(Constants.appOwnership)` statement. It may inconsistently return `null`.

## Solution
The provided solution employs a fallback mechanism and more robust checking to handle potential `null` values returned by the `Constants.appOwnership` API.  This ensures that your application's logic proceeds correctly, regardless of the API's return value.
